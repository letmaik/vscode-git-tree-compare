## 1.1.4

* Fixed extension only working on git >= 2.13, now works on older version again.

## 1.1.3

* Added support for type change (T) git status
* Fixed extension not working when using `git worktree` [#28](https://github.com/letmaik/vscode-git-tree-compare/issues/28)

## 1.1.2

* Restore original extension activation behaviour (only enable if a git repo is in the workspace)

## 1.1.1

* Fixed extension activation not working on VS Code 1.16.0.
Note that this is a temporary work-around which now always enables the extension, even if the workspace has no git repository (previously the extension would be disabled then). The work-around is necessary due to a [breaking change in VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/33618) and makes sure that the extension keeps working for users with versions older than 1.16.0 as well as for newer versions.
Once VS Code 1.16.0 is rolled out to all users the final fix will be applied and the original behaviour can be restored. 
For details see [#23](https://github.com/letmaik/vscode-git-tree-compare/issues/23).
